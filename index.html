        <p>Hey! What's up! My name is JosÃ© Manuel Vega, and I am from Tarija, Bolivia. I am currently learning,
            programming, a field that excites me because of my passion for technology and its profound impact on
            humanity. Beyond my studies, I enjoy exploring nature through camping, and I find freedom and adventure in
            riding my motorcycle. I also have a deep appreciation for art, as it inspires creativity and new
            perspectives. In addition, I am passionate about basketball, which teaches me teamwork and discipline, and I
            value fashion as a way to express individuality and identity.</p>
